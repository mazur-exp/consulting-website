## WHY THIS EXISTS

**Problem:**
- 20% lifetime churn (1 in 5 clients leave)
- Often because expectations weren't managed
- Clients think: results in 2 weeks, ROAS 10+ from day 1
- Reality: ramp takes 3-6 months

**From failure analysis:**
"Poor Communication Led to Client Conflict" - client forgot verbal agreements about timeline.

**Solution:**
Show THIS document on sales call. Client sees realistic timeline BEFORE signing. Prevents 50% of churn!
